# FitGenius

## Introduction:
In a world driven by technology, smart devices have become an integral part of our lives, transforming the way we manage our health and wellness. Smart devices, such as fitness watches, have revolutionized health management by providing real-time data on various aspects of well-being, including heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity. This empowers users to take control of their health, leading to better health outcomes. 

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of our personalized fitness software, FitGenius, is to create a  platform that leverages data collected from smart devices to provide users with highly tailored health and fitness recommendations and tips. FitGenius aims to leverage data generated by smart devices, such as fitness watches and health trackers, to develop a deep understanding of each user's unique health and wellness profile. Overall, the combination of data from a smart device and an AI automated dashboard can revolutionize the way individuals approach their fitness journeys, making it more personalized, efficient, and informed.
